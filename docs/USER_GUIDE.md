## Working with Sages

### Choosing the Right Sage

Each Sage specializes in specific domains. Match your need to their expertise:

- **Creative Sages**: Writing, art, music, storytelling
- **Technical Sages**: Code, math, engineering, data
- **Strategic Sages**: Business, planning, decision-making
- **Social Sages**: Communication, relationships, culture
- **Learning Sages**: Education, tutoring, skill development

### Getting Better Responses

**Do:**
- Be specific about what you need
- Provide context
- Ask follow-up questions
- Use mood selector for tone adjustment

**Don't:**
- Ask Sages to work outside their domain
- Expect instant expertise in everything
- Share sensitive personal information

### Domain Boundaries

Sages are designed to stay within their expertise. If you ask something outside their domain:
- They'll acknowledge limitations
- Suggest a better-suited Sage
- Offer to escalate to Council

This is a **feature, not a bug** - specialization creates better answers.
